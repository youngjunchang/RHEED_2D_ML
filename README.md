# <RHEED_Video_Analysis Using PCA & K-means Clustsering>

## Description

This project aims to utilize RHEED_videos in characterizing thin films grown by molecular deposition.
Principle Component Analysis(PCA) and K-means Clustering are used to apply an unsupervised learning and categorize the data by its statistical importance.
This project provides interactive python notebooks(PCA.ipynb & Kmeans.ipynb) that were used in applying PCA and K-means Clustering, which is applicable to other videos as well.
The provided python file(PCA_Kmeans.py) is the collection of defined functions used in the process.

## How to Use

To apply PCA and K-means CLustering:

Change (name = "B303_Trim") in box[2] of PCA to (name = "YOUR_FILE_NAME").
The code accepts mp4 files by default although this may be modified.

Run PCA.ipynb and then Kmeans.ipynb
Running the PCA file will automatically save the following contents
